## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge consolidated my flexbox knowledge. I made the page responsive with minimal use of media query. I relied on flexbox techniques like `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`.

### Continued development

My next target is mastering CSS Grid Box.

### Useful resources

- [This article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) was of great help. It gave the entire mental model based on which I approach flexbox techniques.
- [Flexbox Zombie](https://flexboxzombies.com/p/flexbox-zombies) is another way quickly understand flexbox.
